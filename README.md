# ElderFuthark-Translator
A .exe file to translate your text to a Elder Futhark text

This python code was created while studying the Tkinter library. First, I tried to use another library (pyperclip) to make the translated text usable for the user. However, despite working fine on my computer, when generating the .exe it gave an error. That's why I temporarily chose to generate the .txt for the user to get the translated text.
